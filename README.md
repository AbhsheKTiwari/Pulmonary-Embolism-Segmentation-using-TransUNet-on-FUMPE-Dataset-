# Pulmonary-Embolism-Segmentation-using-TransUNet-on-FUMPE-Dataset-
Applied a transformer-based TransUNet model on the FUMPE dataset (Kaggle) for pulmonary embolism segmentation.  Preprocessed CT scan slices and trained with Dice loss; achieved stable convergence with high accuracy across epochs.  At 50 epochs, the model achieved Dice Coefficient ≈ 0.85.2%
